Cultivate Deep Relationships**\nInvest in quality relationships over quantity. Schedule regular quality time with loved ones and practice active listening.\n\n**3. Practice Gratitude Daily**\nKeep a gratitude journal. Research shows that acknowledging 3 things you're grateful for each day significantly improves well-being.\n\n**4. Serve Others**\nVolunteer, mentor, or simply help someone in need. Contributing to something larger than yourself is a proven path to meaning.\n\n**5. Embrace Growth Over Comfort**\nStep outside your comfort zone regularly.

Assess your natural talents and skills\n3. Explore what you're passionate about\n4. Consider what the world needs\n\n**The Ikigai Model:**\nFind the intersection of:\n- What you love\n- What you're good at\n- What the world needs\n- What you can be paid for\n\n**Practical Steps:**\n1. Try many things \u2014 cast a wide net\n2. Pay attention to what energizes you\n3. Talk to people who inspire you\n4. Set small experiments, not big commitments\n5. Give yourself permission to change direction\n\n**Mindset Shifts:**\n- There's no single \"right\" answer\n- Your path will likely change multiple times\n- Action beats overthinking\n- Comparison is the thief of joy\n\nMost importantly, be patient with yourself.
